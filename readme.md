# Maze Runner

## About
Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. In this project, a program generates mazes and looks for a way out.

## Usage
* Random class with lists and multidimensional arrays 
* store the results in a file.
